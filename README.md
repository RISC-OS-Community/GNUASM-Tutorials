# GNU Assembler Tutorials on RISC OS

This repository contains a set of GNU Assembly source code, which we discuss on our YouTube channel, to help people who wish to learn how to code with GNU Assembler on RISC OS Operating System and on ARM (AArch32) platform.

All the tutorial code are divided in directories with their own build and use instructions, so check each code example for more details, thanks.

To have a look at the sources available just check the `src` directory in this repository.

## How to contribute to this project

All this project needs are more GNU Assembly code examples and possibly provided together with an instructional video (but this is not a must) that describes what the code does and how to use it.
