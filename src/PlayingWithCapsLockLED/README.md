# Playing with CapsLock LED in GNU Assembly on RISC OS

This simple code example shows how to use RISC OS SWIs (SysCalls) in GNU Assembly as well as how to use Kernel CallBacks mechanisms in our own code.

## How to build the code

Ensure you have the GNUGCC suite installed on your RISC OS system and that RISC OS Desktop Filer has see it.

Git clone this repository in a way that can be reached by your RISC OS system, if you do not know how to do this have a look at [this set of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEnraaJ9VQfWDl5T4D0P51pG89KRzj0n1) on the matter that can help you to find the best approach for you to use git with your RISC OS.

Then, from your RISC OS system, double click on the file called MkGCC or have a look at the sources in the subdirectory names `s`

For a full description of how the code works have a look at this video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U37_xn6MpM&t=144s)
